**Run javascript on http server**
1. open cmd terminal
2. cd to directory containing the javascript file (C:\Users\wying\Desktop\capstone-github\)
3. type 'python -m http.server' to start local http server
4. js file is hosted here: http://127.0.0.1:8000/test_script.js

why do i need to do this?
- chrome bookmarklet 'not allowed to load local resource' error
- this is a security exception built into Chrome and other modern browsers.
